# Upfire

Upfire is the first-ever decentralized P2P file-sharing platform. Our project is open source and anyone can contribute to development.

## Purpose

The main goal of this decentralized application is to enable users to directly exchange their files for cryptocurrency. This empowers users to set their own prices for their content and removes the middleman.

## How to contribute?

1. Fork the repository. 
2. Do your changes and create a pull request.
3. When the pull request is merged into the main branch, the dapp will be built on Github.
4. Find the builds [here](https://github.com/UpfireHQ/upfire/actions).
